\subsubsection{Context-Aware Counterfactual Explanations}

We developed a novel approach to generating clinically meaningful counterfactual explanations that respect medical constraints and patient-specific contexts. Unlike generic counterfactual methods that may suggest implausible interventions, our system incorporates clinical knowledge to ensure that suggested modifications are achievable and medically sound. The counterfactual engine generates multi-step intervention paths rather than single-point alternatives, providing clinicians with actionable roadmaps for risk reduction. By grouping related interventions and calculating their combined effects, the system supports comprehensive treatment planning that addresses multiple risk factors simultaneously. User studies demonstrated that these context-aware counterfactuals significantly influenced clinical decision-making, leading to more targeted and aggressive risk reduction strategies.
