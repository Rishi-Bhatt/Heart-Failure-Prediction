\section{Introduction}

Heart failure (HF) affects approximately 26 million people worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs \cite{McDonagh2021}. The global burden of heart failure continues to rise, with a projected increase of 46\% by 2030 \cite{Savarese2022}. Early prediction and intervention can improve outcomes, but implementing effective prediction systems in clinical settings presents several challenges.

The implementation of machine learning models in healthcare faces significant barriers, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Integration challenges}: Healthcare systems use diverse electronic health record (EHR) platforms with varying levels of interoperability \cite{Ghassemi2020}.
    \item \textbf{Interpretability requirements}: Clinicians require transparent explanations for predictions to trust and act on model outputs \cite{Rudin2022}.
    \item \textbf{Data quality issues}: Clinical data often contains missing values, inconsistencies, and measurement errors \cite{Elshawi2020}.
    \item \textbf{Model maintenance}: Models can degrade over time as patient populations and clinical practices evolve, requiring regular retraining \cite{Davis2020}.
\end{itemize}

To address these challenges, we implemented a hybrid heart failure prediction system that combines rule-based clinical knowledge with machine learning techniques. Our key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A modular system architecture that facilitates integration with clinical workflows
    \item A hybrid integration layer that combines predictions from rule-based and machine learning models
    \item Implementation of NT-proBNP biomarker integration with age-adjusted thresholds
    \item A temporal forecasting module for longitudinal risk trajectory prediction
    \item A scenario-specific insights module that provides personalized recommendations
    \item An automated model retraining module with drift detection capabilities
\end{itemize}

This paper focuses on the technical implementation details of our system, including data processing, model development, system integration, and evaluation. We describe the challenges encountered during implementation and the solutions developed to address them. We also present performance metrics and discuss the implications for clinical practice.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the system architecture. Section III presents the data processing pipeline and model implementation. Section IV details the model retraining module. Section V describes the hybrid integration layer and key features. Section VI presents the evaluation results. Section VII discusses implementation challenges, limitations, and future work.
