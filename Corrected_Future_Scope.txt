\section{Future Scope}

The proposed hybrid model for heart failure prediction, which integrates rule-based clinical knowledge, logistic regression, and Random Forest approaches, has demonstrated strong performance with 91\% accuracy. However, several promising avenues exist for further enhancement and expansion. One significant future direction is the incorporation of more sophisticated machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models for ECG analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could be applied to process the full 12-lead ECG data rather than the limited features currently extracted, potentially capturing subtle patterns indicative of early heart failure. Additionally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer models could analyze the temporal dynamics in longitudinal patient data, offering improved prediction of heart failure progression over time.

A critical area for future development is enhancing the NT-proBNP biomarker integration. While our current model implements age-adjusted thresholds, future iterations could incorporate more sophisticated biomarker panels including troponin, galectin-3, and ST2, which have shown promise in recent heart failure research. The model could also be extended to differentiate between heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), which require different treatment approaches. Furthermore, the counterfactual explanation engine could be expanded to provide more personalized intervention recommendations based on patient-specific characteristics and comorbidities.

The automated model retraining functionality, currently implemented with basic drift detection, could be enhanced with more sophisticated techniques such as continual learning and domain adaptation. This would allow the model to maintain high performance as clinical practices evolve and patient demographics change. Additionally, federated learning approaches could enable multi-center model training without compromising patient privacy, significantly expanding the available training data. Finally, while our current model provides explanations through feature importance and counterfactuals, future work should focus on implementing more advanced Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for the hybrid model as a whole, rather than for individual components. This would further enhance interpretability for clinicians and potentially increase adoption in clinical settings.
