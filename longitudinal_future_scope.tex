Additionally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer models could analyze the temporal dynamics in longitudinal patient data, offering improved prediction of heart failure progression over time. These advanced models could capture complex temporal dependencies and patterns that our current approach might miss, potentially improving the accuracy of long-term forecasts. Furthermore, the longitudinal tracking component could be enhanced with automated detection of significant trend changes and early warning systems for rapid deterioration, enabling more proactive clinical intervention.
