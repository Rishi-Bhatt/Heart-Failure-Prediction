% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the implementation details of a novel hybrid heart failure prediction system that combines rule-based clinical knowledge with machine learning techniques. We describe the system architecture, data processing pipeline, and integration of a Random Forest model (500 trees) with clinical rules derived from cardiovascular guidelines. The implementation incorporates NT-proBNP biomarker data with age-adjusted thresholds, temporal forecasting for longitudinal risk trajectories, and scenario-specific insights for personalized recommendations. We detail the technical challenges encountered during development and the solutions implemented, including feature engineering, model calibration, and the hybrid integration layer. Performance evaluation on multiple datasets (n=12,546) demonstrates that our implementation achieves superior discrimination (AUC 0.89) compared to standalone approaches while maintaining clinical interpretability. The system's modular architecture facilitates deployment in clinical settings and integration with existing electronic health record systems.
