\subsubsection{Longitudinal Risk Trajectory Modeling}

We developed a novel approach to modeling longitudinal risk trajectories that combines current risk assessment with trend extrapolation and time-dependent adjustments. This approach enables accurate forecasting of heart failure risk over multiple time horizons (6 months, 1 year, 2 years) with well-calibrated confidence intervals. The system's ability to model intervention impacts on risk trajectories provides clinicians with valuable decision support for treatment planning and patient education.
