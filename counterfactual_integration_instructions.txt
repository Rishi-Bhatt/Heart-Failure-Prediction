# Instructions for Integrating Counterfactual Explanations into Your IEEE Paper

Follow these steps to incorporate the counterfactual explanation component into your existing IEEE paper:

## 1. Add to the System Analysis and Methodology Section

After the "Explainability and Visualization" subsection (or after the longitudinal tracking section if you've already added that), add the content from:
- `counterfactual_explanation_section.tex`

This will add a comprehensive explanation of the counterfactual explanation engine, including the mathematical formulations and methodology.

## 2. Add to the Evaluation Section

After the "Explainability Assessment" subsection (or after the longitudinal evaluation section if you've already added that), add the content from:
- `counterfactual_evaluation_section.tex`

This will provide evaluation metrics for the counterfactual explanation capabilities, including both technical validation and clinical utility assessment.

## 3. Add to the Unique Contributions and Innovations Section

Add the content from `counterfactual_contribution_section.tex` as a new point in your "Unique Contributions and Innovations" section.

## 4. Update the Abstract

Add a sentence to your abstract mentioning the counterfactual explanation capabilities, such as:

"The system provides context-aware counterfactual explanations that respect clinical constraints and generate actionable intervention paths for risk reduction."

## 5. Update the Flowchart

If you're including the system flowchart in your paper, use the updated version from `updated_flowchart_with_counterfactuals.txt` which includes the counterfactual generation components.

## 6. Update References

If you add these sections, you may want to add some references to support the counterfactual explanation approaches. Consider adding references to papers on:
- Counterfactual explanations in healthcare
- Clinically feasible intervention modeling
- Explainable AI for medical decision support

## 7. Check Formatting

After adding these sections, check the overall formatting of your paper to ensure:
- The equations are properly formatted and numbered
- The tables fit within the column width
- The section numbering is consistent
- The paper still fits within the 6-page IEEE conference format limit

You may need to adjust the content slightly to fit within your page limits while maintaining the key information about counterfactual explanations.
