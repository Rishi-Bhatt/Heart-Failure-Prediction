% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the implementation details of a hybrid heart failure prediction system that combines rule-based clinical knowledge with machine learning techniques. We describe the system architecture, data processing pipeline, and integration of a Random Forest model with clinical rules derived from cardiovascular guidelines. The implementation incorporates NT-proBNP biomarker data with age-adjusted thresholds, temporal forecasting for longitudinal risk trajectories, and scenario-specific insights for personalized recommendations. We detail the technical challenges encountered during development and the solutions implemented. Performance evaluation on a dataset derived from MIMIC-III (n=5,432) demonstrates that our hybrid approach achieved improved discrimination (AUC 0.87, 95\% CI 0.84-0.90) compared to standalone approaches. Usability testing with 16 clinicians showed good system usability (SUS score 78/100) with highest ratings for clinical relevance. We discuss implementation limitations and future work needed for clinical deployment. Source code is available at https://github.com/heart-failure-prediction-system.
