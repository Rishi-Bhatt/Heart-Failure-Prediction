\section{System Architecture}

We implemented a modular, microservices-based architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of integration with existing clinical systems. Fig. 1 illustrates the high-level system architecture.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}

The system consists of the following main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Interface}: A web-based user interface implemented using React.js with responsive design.
    \item \textbf{Backend API}: A RESTful API implemented using Flask (Python) that handles requests and coordinates the prediction pipeline.
    \item \textbf{Prediction Engine}: The core component that implements the hybrid prediction model.
    \item \textbf{Data Processing Module}: Handles data validation, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
    \item \textbf{Temporal Forecasting Module}: Implements time series analysis and forecasting for longitudinal risk trajectories.
    \item \textbf{Scenario Modeling Module}: Enables "what-if" analysis with counterfactual explanations and scenario-specific insights.
    \item \textbf{Database}: A PostgreSQL database for storing patient data, model parameters, and prediction results.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Technologies}

The system was implemented using the following technologies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend}: React.js, Redux, D3.js for visualizations
    \item \textbf{Backend}: Python 3.9, Flask 2.0.1, Gunicorn
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning}: Scikit-learn 1.0.2, NumPy, Pandas
    \item \textbf{Rule Engine}: Custom implementation in Python
    \item \textbf{Database}: PostgreSQL 13
    \item \textbf{Containerization}: Docker, Docker Compose
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment Options}

The system was designed for flexible deployment options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development environment}: Local Docker Compose setup for development and testing
    \item \textbf{Testing environment}: Containerized deployment for integration testing
    \item \textbf{Production prototype}: Single-server deployment with database replication
\end{itemize}

It's important to note that while we designed the system with production deployment in mind, the current implementation is a research prototype that would require additional engineering work for full-scale clinical deployment.
